One is that you may know things about your data that USoft cannot know, so that you can make the application faster by having a say in constraint evaluation. The other is user-friendliness. The standard time when the Rules Engine reports some type of rule may be when the user has finished editing a record and exits it, but you may have reasons why you want the user to get a message or confirmation as soon as she has finished editing an individual ',(0,i.jsx)(t.em,{children:"field"})," in the record.
