In a USoft application, you cannot perform an INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE in a table without also having the Rules Engine perform a query (SELECT) from that table under the hood. It is quite easy to see why and how. Just record a profile of any data manipulation operation in USoft Benchmark, and then inspect the profile steps. This technical dependency is given form in the visible access rights dependency. This is not so much a semantic decision by USoft, but rather a decision to have access rights reflect the workings of the Rules Engine."})]})}function d(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,r.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,r.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},72092:(e,t,s)=>{s.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=s.p+"assets/images/a3c3c65a-2b3e-48ec-b4c7-abdc0b7f3e5e-1e157f5e2aae87590fee17d2bcaf4a78.png"}}]);
