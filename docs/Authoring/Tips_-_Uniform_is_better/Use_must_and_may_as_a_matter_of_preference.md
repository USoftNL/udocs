# Use must and may as a matter of preference

In English, the modal aspect of a business rule or advice can be expressed in many different ways, but it is always possible to capture it using a simple modal auxiliary: **must** or **may**, possibly in combination with **not** or **only**.

There is not really a good reason to use anything else than **must** and **may**.
