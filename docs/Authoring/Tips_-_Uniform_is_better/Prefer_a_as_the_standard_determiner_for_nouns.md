# Prefer -a- as the standard determiner for nouns

In English (and this entire discussion applies pretty much to Dutch as well), there are many alternatives for expressing that a rule applies to all cases. Among these alternatives, it is convenient to choose a simple indefinite article (**a** or **an** - click [here](/docs/Authoring/Tips%20-%20Good%20grammar%20and%20style%20pay%20off/A%20or%20An.md) for the difference).

“A client ...” means: “Each time a client comes along who spends …”:


<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Prefer:</th>
<th>Rather than:</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td rowspan="54">
<p>
<strong>A</strong> client who spends over € 50,000 in a given year</p>
<p>must be assigned a Personal Coach.</p>
</td>
<td>
<strong>Every</strong> client who spends ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>All</strong> clients who spend ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Clients</strong> who spend ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Each</strong> client who spends ...</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<strong>Any</strong> client who spends ...</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Why?

The alternatives really mean exactly the same thing. But if you stick with **a(n)**…,

- Your readers do not need to switch between all these alternatives and worry if perhaps the differences mean something.
- A rulebase with many rules is easier to scan through if you go for uniformity.
- As a writer, you do not need to make a choice between alternatives that mean the same thing anyway.

If you have 2 times **a**, usually one of these must be replaced by **the**:

|**Write:**|**Avoid:**|
|--------|--------|
|**The** destination port of **a** flight booking must be specified.|**A** destination port of **a** flight booking must be specified.|



If there are no conditions at all, **a** sounds strange. Prefer **each** in these cases:

|**Good:**|**Less good:**|
|--------|--------|
|**Each** Gold Card customer must be assigned a personal coach.|**A** Gold Card customer must be assigned a personal coach.|



With **a(n)** …, you write in the singular. As a result, you are often confronted with **he** or **she**:

|**Prefer:**|**Rather than:**|
|--------|--------|
|**An** incoming passenger must pass ID control before **she** is allowed to pass customs.|Incoming passengers must pass ID control before they are allowed to pass customs.|



> [!TIP]
> One simple gender-neutral strategy is to switch regularly between **he** and **she**, just randomly choosing one or the other. You can also write **he or she** but this makes a rule harder to read.

**… is the fact that …** is a set phrase that always contains **the**, not **a**:

|**Write:**|**Avoid:**|
|--------|--------|
|A flight booking is **the** fact that a client books a flight.|A flight booking is **a** fact that a client books a flight.|
