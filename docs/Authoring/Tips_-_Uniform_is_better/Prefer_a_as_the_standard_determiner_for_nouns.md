# Prefer -a- as the standard determiner for nouns

In English (and this entire discussion applies pretty much to Dutch as well), there are many alternatives for expressing that a rule applies to all cases. Among these alternatives, it is convenient to choose a simple indefinite article (**a** or **an** - click [Good grammar and style](/docs/Authoring/Tips_-_Good_grammar_and_style_pay_off/A_or_An.md) for the difference).

“A client ...” means: “Each time a client comes along who spends …”:

| Prefer:                                                                                     | Rather than:                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **A** client who spends over € 50,000 in a given year must be assigned a Personal Coach. | **Every** client who spends ... |
| **A** client who spends over € 50,000 in a given year must be assigned a Personal Coach. | **All** clients who spend ...   |
| **A** client who spends over € 50,000 in a given year must be assigned a Personal Coach. | **Clients** who spend ...       |
| **A** client who spends over € 50,000 in a given year must be assigned a Personal Coach. | **Each** client who spends ...  |
| **A** client who spends over € 50,000 in a given year must be assigned a Personal Coach. | **Any** client who spends ...   |

**Why?**

The alternatives really mean exactly the same thing. But if you stick with **a(n)**…,

- Your readers do not need to switch between all these alternatives and worry if perhaps the differences mean something.
- A rulebase with many rules is easier to scan through if you go for uniformity.
- As a writer, you do not need to make a choice between alternatives that mean the same thing anyway.

If you have 2 times **a**, usually one of these must be replaced by **the**:

|**Write:**|**Avoid:**|
|--------|--------|
|**The** destination port of **a** flight booking must be specified.|**A** destination port of **a** flight booking must be specified.|

If there are no conditions at all, **a** sounds strange. Prefer **each** in these cases:

|**Good:**|**Less good:**|
|--------|--------|
|**Each** Gold Card customer must be assigned a personal coach.|**A** Gold Card customer must be assigned a personal coach.|

With **a(n)** …, you write in the singular. As a result, you are often confronted with **he** or **she**:

|**Prefer:**|**Rather than:**|
|--------|--------|
|**An** incoming passenger must pass ID control before **she** is allowed to pass customs.|Incoming passengers must pass ID control before they are allowed to pass customs.|

:::tip

One simple gender-neutral strategy is to switch regularly between **he** and **she**, just randomly choosing one or the other. You can also write **he or she** but this makes a rule harder to read.

:::

**… is the fact that …** is a set phrase that always contains **the**, not **a**:

|**Write:**|**Avoid:**|
|--------|--------|
|A flight booking is **the** fact that a client books a flight.|A flight booking is **a** fact that a client books a flight.|
