# Rephrase to a concept that USoft Studio recognises

USoft Studio cannot deal with all conceivable concept declarations.

*Example*

In SBVR it is possible to model unary fact types that USoft Studio does not recognise:

![](/api/Authoring/Tips%20-%20Writing%20for%20USoft%20Studio/assets/8d89bdf2-11eb-43ad-9c7e-71dfab1500c2.png)

![](/api/Authoring/Tips%20-%20Writing%20for%20USoft%20Studio/assets/ce2e8ddf-e97f-4a7d-abf8-5b4b08461030.png)

Get around this problem by rephrasing to a concept that USoft Studio does recognise:
