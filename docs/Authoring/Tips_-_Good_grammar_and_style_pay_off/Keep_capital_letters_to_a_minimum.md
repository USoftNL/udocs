There are only 3 good reasons for writing a capital letter:

- As the first letter of a sentence.
- To respect the way that proper names are spelled. Proper names are names of individual concepts, for example companies, countries and brands.
- In phrases that are abbreviated. Make sure you spell the abbreviation with all-capitals (WHO). When you write out the name in full, use initial capitals (World Heath Organisation).
