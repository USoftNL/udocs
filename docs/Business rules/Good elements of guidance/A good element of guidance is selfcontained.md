A good element of guidance is self-contained. This principle has a lot of overlap with the [severability](/docs/Business%20rules/Good%20elements%20of%20guidance/A%20good%20element%20of%20guidance%20is%20severable.md) principle. Severability means the element of guidance can stand on its own. Self-containedness means that all the intended meaning is in the element of guidance itself:

[SBVR 1.5, 16.3.3 "The Wholeness Principle”:]

Principle: An element of guidance means only exactly what it says, so it must say everything it means.

(...) Each element of guidance must be self-contained…

… The full impact of an element of guidance for a body of shared guidance, of course, cannot be understood in isolation…

… Each element of guidance can be taken at face value for whatever it says.
