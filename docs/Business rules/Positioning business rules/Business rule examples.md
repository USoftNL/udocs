# Business rule examples

Here are some examples of business rules. They have things in common, but they are also very different:

|**Business rule examples**|
|--------|
|A driver must be 23 years of age.|
|Upon entering an aircraft, a passenger must show a valid ID showing a picture that bears his or her resemblance.|
|An incoming passenger must pass ID control before they she is allowed to pass customs.|
|A customer whose yearly order total exceeds $ 10,000 must be assigned a personal financial coach.|



## A business rule is short, concise

A business rule is almost always a **single** sentence with a capital letter at the beginning and a full stop at the end. This makes rules relatively short and easy-to-digest.

We say that a business rule is *atomic.* The idea is that it only makes a single point. You don't have to follow a line of reasoning or keep in mind a structure of arguments.

## A business rule is in natural language

A business rule does not contain technical codes or material that outsiders don’t know without training. Rules use normal, everyday English or Dutch. “Natural language” means a language naturally spoken by millions of people, but it also means “informal, simple, clear” as opposed to jargon that is hard to follow.

## A business rule contains ‘must’ or another modal element

All the examples at the top of this article contain the word **must**. They tell you something must be done, or must be the case. It’s an intention or wish, not necessarily a fact in reality. People must do something, but they don't always do it.

**Must** transmits the idea of a necessity or obligation. We say it is a *modal* element. Modal means: “not factual”. Another modal element is **may**, which transmits the idea of possibility or permission. You can also say **it is necessary that**…, **it is permitted that**… .

## A business rule is self-sufficient

A business rule tells the reader something that is so easy to interpret that you do not typically need *more* information. This is an ideal to strive for, rather than a reality. In reality you need more: good definitions of the terms used in the rules, and good consistency between a rule and neighbouring other rules.

## You don’t need to say when the rule is needed

A rule concentrates on what must happen: the desired business conduct or behaviour. It can only do that by not addressing secondary aspects. The question of when the rule is *needed* (or *tested*) is such a secondary concern. Sometimes it is economical not to *need* to go into this detail. In a car rental company, “A driver must have a valid driving license” is probably needed when the client registers as the future driver of a rental car, but it could also apply at the time when the person actually gets in the car. If the difference is important, the rule must state it.

## You don’t need to say what happens to people who violate the rule

A rule is not a fact: there can be all sorts of reasons why people in the business *violate* (do not comply with) the rule. Rules must be enforced. There are *levels of enforcement.* Is the rule enforced as a mild suggestion? Or can people lose their job over it? Level of enforcement is a separate thing. It's not the rule itself.

## You don’t need to say if software is needed to enforce the rule

In a USoft setting, business rules serve software development projects. But a business rule is not a software rule. It does not typically go into the detail of whether or not software must be built to support people in following the rule. A rule can be helpful or essential to software development teams even if they do not directly implement it in code. It’s also not a black-and-white matter: there are rules that software can implement to the full 100%, but very often, software *contributes* to enforcing a rule.
