# Rules rely on concept structure

In USoft, the meaning of business rules depends crucially not just on what the rules themselves have to say, but also on *concept structure* and on *definitions.*

Concept structure and definitions are part of business vocabulary. The most original and powerful idea in OMG’s Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules is that your model is based on 2 pillars: vocabulary and rules. This is reflected even in the *name* of the OMG standard:

The power of [combining rules and definitions](/docs/Business%20rules/Positioning%20business%20rules/Rules%20and%20definitions%20are%20interrelated.md) is often underestimated. But it is easy to grasp. Most people readily accept that rules are clearer if you have a glossary of terms-and-definitions where the terms used in the rules are explained.

The idea that rules rely also on *concept structure* is a little harder to grasp. In SBVR, “Vocabulary” is not just a glossary of terms-and-definitions: meaning is hidden not only in definitions but also in interrelationships between concepts.

Concept structure is best visualised in OMG-style object diagrams that USoft calls "SBVR Concept Diagrams” and that you can draw in the USoft Studio tool. Below is an example.

As an example of how structure affects meaning, consider the fact that ‘car’ is a category of ‘vehicle’. That means that all the characteristics of 'vehicles’ automatically also apply to 'cars’ and that ‘cars’ are involved in all the verb concepts in which 'vehicle’ is involved (such as the fact of having a numberplate and being in a price category).

The USoft Studio tool is designed to help you make the most of the meaningful interrelationship between rules, definitions and concept structure.
