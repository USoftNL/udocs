# USoft Studio quick tour

USoft Studio helps you write business rules, terms and definitions in an optimal way. You can (optionally) add BPMN, SBVR, E/R and other diagrams.

Business knowledge in this form is ideal as input for developers who build a low-code USoft Rules Engine. This is easily combined with user stories for an Agile approach to delivery.

Conventional software requirements often disappear in a bottom drawer once the software is finished. Business rules are a better alternative: they remain a stable asset that you can typically re-use time and again. They express not just what the software must do, but also the business context that the software must support.

## Natural-language interpreter

At the heart of USoft Studio is an interpreter that has knowledge of English and Dutch grammar. All you need to do is type sentences in everyday English or Dutch. The interpreter will immediately process and structure everything you type. In particular, the interpreter will recognise business terms and structures that you have already defined. It will signal the concepts it has recognised by colour-coding them. If you have provided a definition, it will be shown to all users hovering the concept with their mouse.

Colour-coded words become **hyperlinks** automatically. This enables you to navigate conveniently between the terms, definitions, business rules and diagrams that you create:

## Concept-based pages

USoft Studio automatically organises your material in handy concept-based pages that are built up from the database as you browse the material. Each page is built around a concept recognised by the interpreter.

## Automatic type recognition

USoft Studio also automatically recognises the TYPE of sentence you have written. It displays this classification type, and organises its pages around it:

## Concept-based search

USoft Studio has a powerful search engine. You can search by words and word combinations as in a normal search engine, but at the same time, you can also search by the concepts that the interpreter has recognised:

## Diagram - Text Cross-referencing

USoft Studio contains a diagrammer that allows you to create [BPMN](https://www.omg.org/bpmn/index.htm), [SBVR](https://www.omg.org/spec/SBVR), EAR (Entity-Attribute-Relationship), Actor-Transaction Diagrams (for [Enterprise Ontology](https://demo.nl)), and other diagrams.

Any text that you use in diagram drawings is automatically cross-referenced with the text you use in terms, definitions and business rules. Navigation between the two is offered as soon as you click.

## A tool for teamworking

USoft Studio is a stand-alone website that USoft delivers as a flexible SaaS product. All stakeholders can securely access business information in a **single** place, whatever their relationship is with your terms, definitions, business rules, and diagrams. They interact not with documents, but directly with a central structured database. Changes are instantly propagated to all. This way, USoft Studio delivers Single-Point-of-Truth.

The tool has workflow features that allow you to flag items in a number of ways. This enables **task flow:** you can put items in someoneâ€™s queue for approval or other tasks. Tasks and their outcome are traceable.

USoft Studio helps you manage a changing business reality by supporting native **version control** and history logging of your specifications.

## An open environment

The USoft platform where you develop Rules Engines and software applications has a direct link to USoft Studio because of an **import bridge** built into USoft Definer. This allows you one-click synchronisation with the latest version of the business rules relevant for your development team.

USoft Studio also has a **REST API** through which it exposes business knowledge to 3rd-party software.

Moreover, USoft Studio offers standard **XML** export/import utilities. Anything exported (pulled) from USoft Studio can also be **pushed** to USoft Studio on condition that you adhere to the same XML schema. Furthermore, an XML schema for Microsoft Excel is supported. This allows you to export directly to Excel spreadsheets, and to feed external data from Excel spreadsheets into USoft Studio.

Finally, for human consumption, you can also pull data from USoft Studio to document formats. You can define and store Microsoft Word templates in USoft Studio. This allows you to determine and fully customise your Word and PDF output to the last formatted object.
