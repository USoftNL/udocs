# Installing an evaluation license

To install an Evaluation license (without License Server), copy the LICENSE.DAT file to a directory on your client (or to a PC in your network) and indicate the location of the file when the USoft Installation program asks for this information. The installation program will then copy the license file from this location to the USoft installation directory. Once installation is complete the original location of the license file does not influence USoft functions, or the license manager.

> [!NOTE]
> When the LICENSE.DAT file expires (or is renewed), you must replace the old license file with a new license file. You do not need to reinstall USoft Developer.
