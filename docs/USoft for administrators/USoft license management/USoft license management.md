# USoft license management

Before you can install or use USoft products on your system, you must have a valid LICENSE.DAT file installed. During the setup procedure, you will be asked to provide the location of this license file.

License management has been incorporated into the USoft product suite to ensure that use of USoft software components remains within the scope of license agreements.

licenses can be requested by contacting theÂ USoft service Desk (support@usoft.com).

This file contains in an encrypted form the information supplied by you, and confirmed by USoft license registration. Please note that the name of the server and the installation directory of the license daemon are necessary for generating a license file for the server.

There are two types of license available. The type of license that you need depends upon how you will be using the software.

- Server based license (with license server)

This type of license requires a license server, which checks the use of USoft components. This type of license is typically used when the number of concurrent users is to be checked. A copy of the LICENSE.DAT file is required on each client.

- Standalone license (without license server)

This type of license uses a standalone LICENSE.DAT file that does not require a license server, but is only valid for a limited period of time and hostname, after which the license will expire.
