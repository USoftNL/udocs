# Release management: Release phase

*Release* is the operation of collecting all the deliverables that constitute a new version of your USoft application. You collect these from one or more development machines (the source environment) in preparation for delivering these to target machines.

By performing a release, you make a definitive decision about exactly which deliverables are part of the version.

USoft Delivery Manager helps you collect deliverables by offering a number of *release actions* that you can easily include in a sequenced release procedure: a *task* containing *task steps*. The name of each release action starts with the word **Release...** . 

Delivery Manager collects deliverables in a folder structure on the file system called a release tree.

Each release is characterised by a number of release properties. The most characteristic property of a release is its *version name.* The version name**indicates the version of the application that the release is for.

## Other uses of Delivery Manager

Releasing deliverables is not the only use of USoft Delivery Manager. Its capabilities are also available outside a release setting. For this reason, it offers non-release counterparts for many actions aimed at releasing deliverables, for example:

|**Release action**|**Non-release counterpart**|
|--------|--------|
|Release flat files|Create flat files|
|Release metadata|Export metadata|
|Release deliverable application data|Export deliverable appdataExport all appdata|
|Release publication|Publish publication object|
