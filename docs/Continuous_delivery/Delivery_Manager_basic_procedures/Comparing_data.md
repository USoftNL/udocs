# Comparing data

For the concept of comparing metadata or appdata, go to the Compare help topic.

To compare 2 sets of data:

1. Export the first set to an XML data file. Do this by defining and then running a task that executes one of USoft Delivery Manager's Export actions. Alternatively, you can execute a release action that exports data to XML in a release setting. The actions that export data to XML are:

- Export all appdata
- Export deliverable appdata
- Export metadata
- Release deliverable appdata
- Release metadata

2. Export the second set of data to a second XML data file.

3. Define and then run a task that executes the Compare data files action, referring to the 2 data files as "left file" and "right file".
