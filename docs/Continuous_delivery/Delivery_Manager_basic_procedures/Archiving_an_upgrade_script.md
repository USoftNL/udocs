# Archiving an upgrade script

You archive current upgrade scripts for user applications indirectly by moving to the next release version.

Delivery Manager automatically archives scripts that belong to a previous version. This is appropriate, since upgrade scripts are typically version-bound. Automatic archiving prevents you from inadvertently running scripts that applied to a previous version.

### Archiving upgrade scripts

To archive upgrade scripts:

1. Create a new release by choosing Release, Create New Release from the menu.

### Viewing archived scripts

You can view archived scripts by following these steps:

1. Choose Define, Upgrade Scripts from the menu.

The Current Upgrade Scripts window is opened.

2. Press the Archived Upgrade Scripts button at the bottom of the window.

The Archived Upgrade Scripts window is opened.

3. In the top box, query the application that you want to view the archived scripts for.
