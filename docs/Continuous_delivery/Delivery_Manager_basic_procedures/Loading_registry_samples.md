# Loading registry samples

To load registry samples:

1. Choose Tools, Load Registry Samples from the menu.

The Load Registry Samples dialog appears.

2. Check if this dialog contains a warning section (red exclamation mark). If it does, you are about to overwrite registry samples with the same name, that may be valuable to you.

To preserve your own version of the registry samples listed in this warning section, press Cancel, rename the registries listed to some other name, then return to Step 1.

3. Press OK.

The samples have been loaded as Registries. Choose Release, Registries to find them.
