# Reverting to the previous release


:::danger

If you revert to the previous release, all deliverables of the current release are lost.

:::

You can [revert to the previous release](/docs/Continuous_delivery/Understanding_USoft_Delivery_Manager/Release_trees.md):

- The current release folder is deleted from the file system. All the delivered contents in that folder are also deleted.
- Upgrade scripts associated with the current version are deleted from Delivery Manager.

To revert:

1. Choose Release, Current Release from the menu. The Current Release window opens.

2. Press the "Revert to" button at the "Previous release version" field.
