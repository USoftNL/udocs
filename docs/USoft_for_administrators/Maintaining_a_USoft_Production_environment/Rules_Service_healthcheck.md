# Rules Service healthcheck

You can run a health check utility on a **Rules Service** by browsing

```
*host*:*port*/healthcheck
```

For example:

```language-http
http://localhost:7782/healthcheck
```

where *port* is the Windows Service port number of the Rules Service you want to check.

> [!NOTE]
> You can also run a [health check on a USoft Service Framework server](/docs/USoft_for_administrators/Maintaining_a_USoft_Production_environment/Service_Framework_server_healthcheck.md).

Visiting the **/healthcheck** endpoint returns code 200 (OK) if everything is OK, and code 503 (Service unavailable) otherwise.

This API returns a JSON object with the following properties.

|**Property**|**Description**|**Type**|
|--------|--------|--------|
|timestamp|The current date and time in format:|Date value in format:			|
|healthy |An indication of whether the Rules Service runs successfully or not|Boolean |
|application|Name of the USoft application as known in Authorizer|String  |
|message |Explanation of problem|String  |



The **application** property is only displayed if the application is found running in the Rules Service.

The **message** property can show these messages:

|**Message**|**Explanation**|
|--------|--------|
|Application could not be found|The application could not be found running in any Rules Engine.|
|Authorizer could not be found|The Rules Service is running but cannot connect to USoft Authorizer.|
