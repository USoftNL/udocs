# Installing a USoft Development repository

To be able to use USoft Developer effectively, the team needs a USoft Development Repository. This repository is the central store for all objects, definitions and rules which the team defines.

Certain repository tables are always necessary. They are the tables underlying the following product components:

- USoft Authorizer
- USoft Definer

To create USoft Authorizer tables, go to help topic Creating USoft Authorizer tables. To create USoft Definer tables, go to help topic Creating USoft Definer tables.

There are further, optional repository tables that you may or may not want to create:

- If the team is planning to use USoft Benchmark for testing in Development, you also need to create USoft Benchmark tables.  

- If the team is planning to create a USoft Services Platform, you also need to create repository tables for USoft Service Definer. In this case, you also need to instal such a platform in the Development environment. See Service Definer articles in the Knowledge Base.

- If the team is planning to use USoft Delivery Manager for managing and delivering meta-data, you also need to create USoft Delivery Manager tables

After you have set up the entire USoft Development Repository, you need to authorise team members.
