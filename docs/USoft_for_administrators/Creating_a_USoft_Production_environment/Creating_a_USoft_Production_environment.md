# Creating a USoft Production environment


:::tip

In Production, for performance reasons, USoft suggests that you place the RDBMS on a different physical machine than the other application components.

:::

To create a USoft Production environment:

1. Install the USoft products that form the basis for a production environment:

- If you run USoft solutions provided by a web server (ie., either Web Applications with interactive web pages, or service-based APIs, or both) on your production machine, you need to install, configure and run one or more USoft Rules Services.

- If you have end users who are to run USoft client/server (Windows) applications on your production machine, you need to install the USoft product suite itself.

2. Deploy the User Application you have built in Development.

3. Create the USoft application tables in the production database.
