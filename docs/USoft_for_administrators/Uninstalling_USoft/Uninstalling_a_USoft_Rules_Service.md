# Uninstalling a USoft Rules Service

**To uninstall a USoft Rules Service:**

1. Open the USoft Binder file with which the Rules Service was created.

2. Right-mouse click on the Rules Service item and choose Properties.

The Property Sheet for the Rules Service appears.

3. If the Rules Service is still running, press the Stop button.

4. Press the Remove button.

5. Press OK, then press the Save icon (or choose File, Save) in the Binder window.

The service will now no longer appear in the list view of the Services console in the Control Panel. To see this, if this console was already open, make sure you press the Refresh icon.
