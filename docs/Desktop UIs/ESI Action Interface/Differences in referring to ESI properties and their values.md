# Differences in referring to ESI properties and their values

In the ESI action interface, you can only refer to properties by means of their (technical) resource name, preceded by "XtN". So instead of using the Windows Designer's Allow Horizontal Resize property, you have to use "XtNallowHoriz". An overview of these properties and their technical names can be found in "Property Names vs Resource Names"

Also, the prompts displayed for Windows Designer properties may not be the values that are actually stored in the database. See "Allowed Property Values vs Internal Resource Values" for an overview.
