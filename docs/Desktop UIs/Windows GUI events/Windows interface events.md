# Windows interface events

This section lists interface events for which behavior properties exist that allow actions to be defined. The actions are executed when the event occurs.

Interface events can lead to data events. For example, the Leave Field event leads to field validation if the field value was entered or changed.

Interface events may occur in Query Mode as well as in Data Manipulation Mode. They may also occur as the result of transitioning BETWEEN Query Mode and Data Manipulation Mode.
