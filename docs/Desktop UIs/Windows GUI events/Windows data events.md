# Windows data events

This section lists data events for which behavior properties exist that allow actions to be defined. The actions are executed when the event occurs.

Data events can lead to validation routines. For example, the Insert Record event leads to row validation.

Whether the data event occurs in Query Mode or in Manipulation Mode depends on the event definition.
