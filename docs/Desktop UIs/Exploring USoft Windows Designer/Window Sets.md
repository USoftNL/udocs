# Window Sets

You can group info box classes and dialog classes into a *window set*. You would typically group and list only those classes which are actually used in the application being developed. This enables you to concentrate on the particular windows and dialogs that you are designing.

You could, for example, group your windows into window sets on the basis of the task they are a part of. For example, all windows necessary to perform an insert on a table in the context of making a reservation. A typical window set could be an info window for the entity that is inserted; lookup windows (if any); and related windows for mandatory relationships (if any). End user tasks in this type of window set may be combined on the same windows, or spread out across multiple windows that the end user navigates between.

Window sets may be contained in other window sets, and a window can be included in multiple window sets.
