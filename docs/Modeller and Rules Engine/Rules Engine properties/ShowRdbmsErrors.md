## **ShowRdbmsErrors**

The **ShowRdbmsErrors** Rules Engine property can be used to override the [Show_Rdbms_Errors](/docs/Authorisation%20and%20access/Deployment%20configurations/Show_Rdbms_Errors.md) deployment configuration parameter setting for the current deployment context and for the duration of the current session.

> [!TIP]
> You can set deployment configuration parameters in USoft Authorizer for 3 different deployment contexts: Client/Server, RunBatch, and Rules Service.

This setting determines whether or not RDBMS error messages are displayed.
