# Dropdown List Box display type

A **dropdown list box** is a control that contains a list of objects or options from which the end-user can select one.
Guidelines for the use of dropdown list boxes are:

- Display options in a logical order (e.g. alphabetically or numerically).
- Make the display length big enough to display the longest option.
- If there are less than four choices, consider using check boxes or option buttons.
- For each option, consider setting Value and Prompt to the same string value. This keeps you from constantly having to look up the Value-Prompt mapping during development.
