# How to define a subtype table

To define a subtype table:

- Identify the table that is the supertype table.
- Define the columns that are specific to the subtype.

USoft Developer will automatically insert the primary key fields to link the subtype to its supertype.

You can define a subtype table by filling out a form (an info window) or by using the New Subtype wizard. Once the subtype table exists, you can modify it by double-clicking its name in the Project Catalog where it will appear as a **subnode of the supertype table.**

### Filling out a form

To define a subtype table by filling out a form:

1. Choose Define, Tables, Database Tables from the USoft Definer menu.

The Database Tables windows or tab is opened.

2. Provide a Table Name, Abbreviation, Object Name and Object Name Plural for the new subtype table.

3. In the Supertype field, identify the table that is the supertype table.

4. On the Columns tab, define the columns that are specific to the subtype.

5. Save work. Click Create to create the new subtype table in the database.

### Using the New Subtype wizard

To define a subtype table by using the New Subtype wizard:

1. Right-click on the supertype table name in the Project Catalog, and choose New Subtype.

The New Subtype wizard appears.

2. Enter the requested information in each of the wizard's dialogs.

You will be prompted to specify the columns that are to be part of the subtype table.
