# Generate HTML Reports

The Definer allows you to generate reports showing the contents of your tables and columns, domains, and relationships in HTML format, so that they can be viewed with a browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape. This can be useful for documentation or presentation purposes.
To generate HTML pages:

1. From the menu bar, choose Tools, Generate HTML Reports. The Repository Info wizard appears.
2. Fill in the required information in the wizard's dialogs. You can choose which reports are generated, and in which folder they are stored.
