# WindowToClipboard()




:::note

This article is about the **WindowToClipboard** action in the [USoft Action Language](/docs/Task_flow/Action_Language_reference/USoft_Action_Language.md).

## **WindowToClipboard()**

This action copies a bitmap of a user interface component to your clipboard. A user interface component can be any so-called control, for example:

- Window or info box
- Button or scroll bar
- Field name or field value

*Syntax*

```
WindowToClipboard()
```

You can use this action for documentation purposes. For example, if you associate WindowToClipboard() with a button, then the cursor changes into a little hand with a pointing finger when the button is clicked. The tip of the index finger is the part that you must point at the control you wish to copy. Press ALT+TAB to switch to some other application (e.g. a word processor), then use that application's Paste option (or CTRL+V) to copy the bitmap into a document.
