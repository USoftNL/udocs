# Record Separators of external sets

For external sets, you can specify a record separator. This indicates how records are (to be) separated.

The default is a newline character (\\n). You can enter up to four characters, and use the following escape sequences for special characters:

|**\\t** |**tab character**|
|--------|--------|
|\\s     |single-quote character ( ' )|
|\\d     |double-quote character ( " )|
|\\\\    |backslash ( \\ )|



For external sets for an export task, you can also specify column separators at run time.
