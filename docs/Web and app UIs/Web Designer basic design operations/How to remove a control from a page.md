# How to remove a control from a page

To remove a control from a page:

1. Open the page : Right-click on it in the Page tab of the catalog, then choose Open.

2. Expand the Object Tree until you find the control.

> [!TIP]
> An easy way to find an object in the Object Tree is to click on, or near, that object in the Preview Pane.

3. Right-click on the node for the control, then choose Delete.

4. Save your work.

If you remove an object, all contained objects are also removed. As a result, if you remove a container control, all the contained objects will also be removed.

Here are some examples of controls that may be removed in this way:

- Button control
- Frame control
- Grid control
- HTML control
- Image control
- Input control
- Label control
- Script control
- Tab control
- Tree control
- Data Source control
- Event Listener control
- Action control
