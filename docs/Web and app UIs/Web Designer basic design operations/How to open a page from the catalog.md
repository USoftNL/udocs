# How to open a page from the catalog

By default, the catalog is open when you start Web Designer. If it is not open, choose View, Catalog from the menu.

To open a page from the catalog:

1. In the catalog, select the page you want to open.

2. Double-click the page.

You can also drag and drop the page onto the design area, or you can open the context menu and choose Open.
