# Development tasks and team members

Hours of development work are required to make a fully finished USoft web application successful. In practice, almost all this time is spent fine-tuning the default application.

This happens at two different levels:

- In Web Designer, the elements of the default application are customised. The behavior and look-and-feel of the web pages, the navigation between the pages and the interaction between users and data is fine-tuned by making settings and altering default structures. The result of this work is stored in the Web Designer repository. Customisation is relatively easy to do because it does not require much detailed programming knowledge.
- Regular Web design tools are used to give the application a finished look-and-feel. Important technologies at this level are CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), JavaScript and frameworks such as jQuery or Bootstrap.

The ideal team consists of analysts trained in USoft Definer who declare the business model and rules; developers trained in Web Designer who customise the application; and non-USoft visual designers and web developers who provide a finished look-and-feel.
