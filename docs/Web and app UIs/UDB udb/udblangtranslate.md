## **$.udb.lang.translate()**

In a string with variable elements or "markers‚Äù that need to be translated depending on the website's current language, provides the translations for these variable elements.

Returns a string.

*Syntax*

```
$.udb.lang.translate( *string-with-markers* )
```

Each marker is represented by the following syntax:

```
{{*marker*}}
```

You need to have supplied this translation in the language tables of USoft Definer, either as Application String or as Message. The name of the translation item must be *marker*.

*Example*

```
$.udb.lang.translate('<div class="box">{{Hello World}}</div>')
```

This example could return this string if the current language is English:

```language-html
<div class="box">Hello World</div>
```

This example could return this string if the current language is Dutch:

```language-html
<div class="box">Hallo Wereld</div>
```

> [!WARNING]
> **translate****()** is intended only as a dynamic extension of the [standard USoft translation mechanism](/docs/Modeller%20and%20Rules%20Engine/Localising%20your%20application/Localisation%20system%20languages%20translations%20and%20regional%20settings.md). Rely on that standard mechanism unless you need runtime, on-the-fly translations for custom alerts or HTML controls. Use **translate()** only for the latter.
