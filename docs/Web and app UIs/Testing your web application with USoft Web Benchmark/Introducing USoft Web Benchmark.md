# Introducing USoft Web Benchmark

Web Benchmark is a tool for testing web pages developed in USoft Web Designer. It allows you to:

- Record user actions in the web pages, that you can then replay multiple times.

- Get reports (*profiles*) with information of these replay sessions, in particular, the elapse time of the recorded actions under different circumstances.

You can run Web Benchmark by adding the Web Benchmark control to the web pages you want to test.

The Web Benchmark control can be added and removed with relative ease. This allows you to use Web Benchmark in Production, Test and Development environments alike.

The purpose of web pages published from USoft Web Designer is to allow interaction with a USoft Rules Engine.

Physically, the Web Benchmark control is an integral part of these web pages:
