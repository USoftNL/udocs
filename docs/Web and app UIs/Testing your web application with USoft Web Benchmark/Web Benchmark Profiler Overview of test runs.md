# Web Benchmark Profiler: Overview of test runs

By clicking **Overview:**

you can get an overview of all test runs performed by running the profiler.

This overview covers all the test runs performed via **Run profiler:**

It does NOT cover playback sessions started via **Play test:**

or via **Play step:**

This overview offers:

- Cumulative information (totals) on all the test runs in scope, as well as on test runs by test suite.

- Drill-down navigation to information about specific tests, test runs, and test actions.

If you have information that you want excluded from this overview, you can delete the corresponding reports. You can delete reports at test level (delete all reports of a selected test) or at test run level (delete reports of selected test runs).

This same overview is also automatically displayed at the end of each profiler run (each run started by clicking **Run profiler:**

### All last test runs

This section shows the following cumulative information:

|        |        |
|--------|--------|
|Number of tests|The total number of tests (across all test suites) that you have recorded in Web Benchmark. Click Manage tests to obtain a list.|
|Tests executed|The total number of tests (across all test suites) that you have test run information on. Test run information is generated by running the profiler for a test (Run profiler icon).|
|Success |Among the "Tests executed", the number of tests of which the last test run was successful.|
|Failed  |Among the "Tests executed", the number of tests of which the last test run raised an error.|
|Total execution time|The total duration of all last test runs. Each test run is for 1 test. A last test run is the most recent test run for that test.|



 

### Last test runs by test

For each test for which test run information is available, this section offers information about the last test run of that test.

The lines that have a Test Name show the following information for that test:

|        |        |
|--------|--------|
|Message |If the last test run of the test raised an error, this column shows the error message and the line is marked by a red cross.Otherwise, this column is empty and the line is marked by a green tick mark.|
|Runs    |The total number of test runs for which a report is available. You can view these runs by clicking on the Test Name.|
|Last Run|The date and time of the last run for the test.|
|Execution Time|The total duration of the last run for the test.|



 

The lines that have a Suite Name show the following information for the tests in that suite:

|        |        |
|--------|--------|
|Message |This column is empty.If any last test run of a test in this test suite raised an error, the list marked by a red cross.Otherwise, the line is marked by a green tick mark.|
|Runs    |The total number of tests in this test suite for which test run information is available.|
|Last Run|The date and time of the last run for a test in this test suite.|
|Execution Time|The total duration of all last runs for tests in this test suite.|



 

Using this overview, you can navigate to all test runs of a selected test by clicking on the name of that test in the Test Name column. This displays the same view that you get by clicking, for the current, test, **View runs:**

Using this overview, you can also perform a number of actions by pressing buttons at the bottom of the screen:

- You can re-run selected tests in Profiler mode, indicating the number of times you want to re-run the tests.
- You can delete all reports of selected tests.
- You can export execution logs of test runs of selected tests.

To select tests to apply these operations to, you can click checkboxes in the lines for specific tests, and you can click checkboxes in the lines for test suites to select all the tests in that test suite in one go. You can also click the topmost checkbox to select all the items in the overview.
