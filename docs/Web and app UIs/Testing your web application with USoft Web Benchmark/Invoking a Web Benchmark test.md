# Invoking a Web Benchmark test

As part of a test recording, you can invoke another test recorded earlier, that runs in the first test as a sub-procedure.

This is especially useful for short, recurrent test procedures that you tend to use often. You can embed such a procedure in multiple other tests.

To invoke re-usable test procedures, first record them normally as independent tests. Then, to invoke them:

1. Start recording the invoking test.

2. At the point where you want to invoke the test, click **Invoke**:

3. Select the name of the test you want to invoke. Press OK.
