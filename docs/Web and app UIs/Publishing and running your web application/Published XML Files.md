# Published XML Files

The published XML files reflect the internal page structure and presentation definitions of the published pages. The content is generated from information stored in the Web Designer repository.

Here is an example of a part of an .XML file for a page based on a database table called TOUR.

Published .XML files appear in the "xml" folder of the Publication Directory.
