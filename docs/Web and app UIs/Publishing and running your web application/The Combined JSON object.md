# The Combined JSON object

Each time a client browser requests data, the USoft Page Engine makes a new Combined JSON object. The purpose of this object is to merge design-time data specifications with runtime data values and return the outcome of this as a response to the browser. This object is also logged in the

```
*web-publication*\logs
```

folder with a **[Response]** tag in the PageEngine logfile and is visible only if the logging level is set to DEBUG.

This mechanism uses a Combined JSON object. This object has several property values, an authentication info object, and arrays for data and messages:

```language-json
{
    stateId: "1",
    lang: "en",
    loginStatus: "true",
    logonRequired: "true",
    defaultPage: "ApplicationPage",
    eventState: "success",
    commit: "false",
    module: ".",
    Auth: {
        roles: "ADMIN,ROLE1"
    },
    Data: [],
    Message: []
}Â 
```

The most important element is the Data element. This element contains any records that were queried from the database, ordered in a format that the web client can process quickly.

An example of a data query result in the Combined JSON looks as follows:

```language-json
{
    queried: "Y",
    dsId: "1.DS61",
    maxDataSetSize: 20,
    Rows: 
        [    
            {
                refId: "1",
                Row: 
                    [    
                        {
                            $62: "BLA1234",
                            $63: "USOFT",
                            $64: "Here"
                        }, 
                        {
                            $62: "HOI0987",
                            $63: "NESS",
                            $64: "lThereChangedo"
                        }
                    ]
            }
        ],
    Keys: 
        [    "$62"
        ],
    ExtraKeys: [],
    Inserts: [],
    Counts: 
        [    
            {
                refId: "1",
                count: "2"
            }
        ]
}
```

The Auth element contains a reference to the roles of the current user. This has an effect on the menus that this user may see, if a MenuControl based on authorization role is present.

The Message element contains a list of all messages generated by the request. They are immediately displayed on the browser after processing the Combined JSON response object.
