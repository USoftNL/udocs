# SQL underlying a SQLDataSource

In USoft Web Designer, you can have a SELECT statement underlying a data source. Such a datasource is of type [SQLDatasource](/docs/Web%20and%20app%20UIs/Data%20sources/SQLDataSources.md) and is fully defined by the SELECT statement.

This is a general facility for getting data into your web page.

Use this construct for populating web pages with data that you only need for a web UI feature, not at other levels such as rules or services.

Compare this to the SQL Statement object type in the USoft Service Definer tool and to the Logical View object type in the USoft Definer tool.
