# How to make a page read-only

After you have designed a page, you may want to protect it from accidental changes. To do so, you can make it read-only. If pages have been set to read-only, this is indicated in the title bar of the object tree.

> [!NOTE]
> You cannot change the properties of a page that is currently open in the design area. Close the info page first.

To make a page read-only:

1. Select the page in the catalog.

2. Choose Properties from the context menu. The Page Class Properties dialog appears.

3. Check the Read-only check box.

4. Click OK.

To make a page read-write again, clear the Read-only check box.
