# Classes, objects and properties

In a USoft runtime web application, each page and each control is an instance of a class. The behaviour and (if applicable) the look of the runtime software depends on:

- The inheritance hierarchy between one **class** and another.
- The containment hierarchy of **objects** and contained objects that a class contains.
- The **properties** of each of these contained objects.

## Inheritance hierarchy: classes

Web Designer has 3 inheritance hierarchies between classes: one between **page** classes, one for **control** classes, and one for **menu** classes. Each inheritance hierarchy appears on a different tab in the Web Designer catalog on the left-hand side.

When you open a class, the Object Tree tool on the right-hand side of the screen shows the containment hierarchy of objects contained in the class.

## Properties

Finally, you can get and set all the properties of an object by right-mouse-clicking on the object in the containment tree and then choosing Properties. This opens the Property Inspector tool:
