# CSS Example: Highlighting mandatory fields

Here is an example of a style sheet rule that applies to all HTML elements that belong to the mandatory class.

```language-css
td.mandatory, input.mandatory{
    color:red;
}
```

The result is that the text in all mandatory fields and their labels become red. The Mandatory class is an example of a domain class.
