# Export logs

Each time you create an export file on the basis of an Export Definition, details of this action are logged.

To inspect such an export log:

1. Click Teamwork, Object Shopping, Export Logs from the main menu.

2. Query the export log(s) that you are interested in. If you do a default query, the most recent export log appears as the first record.

Each export log is stored as the combination of:

- 1 parent record in parent table Export Logs (T_EXP_LOG).
- A set of child records in child table Export Components (T_EXPORT_COMPONENT).
