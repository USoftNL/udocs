# Blend attributes



> [!NOTE]

Blend attributes are XML attributes that act as input parameters in the USoft Blend scripting language. They are comparable to parameters that you pass to Powershell commands.

The following example script contains 2 Blend directives with attributes. The first is a command to create Authorizer tables. It uses an **application** attribute. The second is a command to fill the tables with data found in an external file. It uses an **alias** attribute and other attributes.

Blend attributes are mainly covered in the articles on the [individual Blend directives](/docs/Repositories/Blend%20directives) that use them.

A small number of Blend attributes have a more general application. They are covered in separate articles in the section of [Blend attributes](/docs/Repositories/Blend%20attributes).

For an introduction to USoft Blend, go to [Introducing Blend scripts](/docs/Repositories/Blend%20scripts%20for%20repository%20management/Introducing%20Blend%20scripts.md).

For a functional overview, go to [Understanding USoft Blend](/docs/Repositories/Blend%20scripts%20for%20repository%20management/Understanding%20USoft%20Blend.md).

In addition to Blend directives, some additional functionality can be scripted by calling [Blend functions](/docs/Repositories/Blend%20functions).
