# Inclusion rules for Domains

This help topic shows which objects, in an export, are automatically included when you include a Domain.

For example, the first two lines mean that if a Domain is included, any superdomains will automatically be included as well.

```
Domain
. . (super)Domain
. . . . (etc.)
. . Allowed Value
. . Domain Constraint
. . Alternative Input Format
```
