# Number_of_Update_Columns



> [!NOTE]
> This article is about the **Number_of_Update_Columns**[deployment configuration parameter](/docs/Authorisation%20and%20access/Deployment%20configurations/Deployment%20configuration%20parameters.md).

## **Number_of_Update_Columns**

*Allowed values*

```
*positive integer*
```

The default value is 10. This is the USoft factory default. It applies if you have not set this deployment parameter to a different value.

*Context*

This parameter may be set for all 3 deployment configuration contexts: Client Server, RunBatch, and Rules Service.

You can set this parameter in the Additional Parameters list at the bottom of the tab page for each context. To get there, in USoft Authorizer, choose Define, Deployment Configurations from the menu.

*Explanation*

This is where you specify what the UPDATE statements generated by USoft Developer will look like. For tables with column counts lower then this value the conceptual processor will generate UPDATE statements that update all columns of the table. This has the advantage that RDBMS cursors created for these statements can be reused. This increases performance.

If the column count of a table is equal to or higher than this value, UPDATE statements on this table will only update the columns actually updated.
