# Web Service Client components

A  **Web Service Client component** is an RDMI component that allows you to call a SOAP service. This may be a third-party SOAP service or a SOAP service that you have previously defined in USoft Service Definer.

To define a Web Service Client component:

1. In USoft Definer, on the Model and Rules tab, expand the **Components** node and then the **DotNet (.NET) Components** node.

2. Right-mouse-click on the **Web Service Components** node.

3. From the context menu, select New Web Service Component. The New Web Service Component wizard opens. Follow the steps of this wizard to create a new Web Service Client component.
