# SOAP Services

A USoft application can be the provider of conventional web services using the SOAP protocol. This was possible even before the advent of the USoft Services Platform in USoft 9:

- Until USoft 9, SOAP services were provided in the context of a USoft application or module, and defined in the USoft Definer Tool.

- In USoft 9, the choice platform for deploying SOAP services is the USoft Services Platform. SOAP services for this platform are defined in the Service Definer tool.

A USoft applications can also be a client of a SOAP service. Calls to a SOAP service can be tied into the Rules Engine behaviour at the individual rule level.

For product documentation on how to provide or consume SOAP services in a USoft application, please refer to the USoft Definer Help and search "web services".

SOAP service provider functionality (and the corresponding product documentation) will be gradually moved from USoft Definer to Service Definer.

### Logging and tracing a SOAP service

Log messages and trace information are important elements when diagnosing problems with SOAP services. USoft provides log and trace possibilities for SOAP services.
