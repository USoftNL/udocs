# Server security settings

In the Servers window or tab, on the Security tab, you can make a number of settings about the use of SSL certificates.

### Key Store

In the case that the server operates with a secure socket layer (HTTPS protocol as opposed to HTTP), this is where you identify the resource where the certificate is stored.

### Key Store Password

In the case that the server operates with a secure socket layer (HTTPS protocol as opposed to HTTP), this is where you identify the password associated with the certificate.

### CORS Configuration

The CORS configuration (= Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration) that is used by the server when it handles requests.

This value determines how permissive the server is with respect to cross-origin requests.
