# Web socket services

A WebSocket service is a software construct that uses WebSocket protocol for the communication between the server and the client. The WebSockets protocol is intended for real-time Internet communication that enables real-time architecture.

The WebSockets protocol is a protocol for two-way communication with a remote host. It defines a full-duplex communication channel that operates through a single socket over the web.

The WebSocket protocol was designed to work with the existing web infrastructure. Following this design principle, the protocol specification defines that a WebSocket connection starts with an HTTP connection. After that, the protocol switches from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol, and this is referred to as a WebSocket handshake.
