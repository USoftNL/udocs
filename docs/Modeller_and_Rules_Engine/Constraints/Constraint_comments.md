# Constraint comments

You can leave comments in your constraint code for yourself and other team members.

One way to do this is to include comments in the actual constraint SQL code. The syntax to use is:

```
/* <my comments> */
```

Another way to do this is to type comments on the Comment tab page on the Constraints info window.
