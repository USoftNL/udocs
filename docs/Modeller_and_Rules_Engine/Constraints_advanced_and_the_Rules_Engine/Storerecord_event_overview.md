# Store-record event overview

The table below affords an overview of all the possible constraint validations that could take place at **store-record event** time.

- It shows the default order in which these potential validations take place.
- It shows the Reason listed for the validation in BenchMark Profiler output.
- Finally, it shows which validation steps potentially apply when the record manipulation is INSERT, when it is UPDATE, and when it is DELETE.
