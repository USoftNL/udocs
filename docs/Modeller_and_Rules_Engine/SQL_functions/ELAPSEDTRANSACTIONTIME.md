## **ELAPSEDTRANSACTIONTIME**

Returns the amount of time in seconds that elapsed since the current transaction started. A transaction starts when a record is locked (for example when starting updating a record), or otherwise when a data manipulation statement (insert, update, delete) is sent to the database.

The elapsed transaction time is reset to 0 (zero) when a commit or rollback takes place.

Syntax

```sql
SELECT    ELAPSEDTRANSACTIONTIME()
```
