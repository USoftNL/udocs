Edit Previous iconto go back to the most recent search criteria you defined for the current Info Box. This is a helpful option if you want to execute a new query for which the search criteria are only slightly different from those of the previous query. You can also edit a previous query instead of having to define an entire new one. The shortcut key for this action is ALT+F2.

## Sorting Query Results

You can sort all queried records on the column that is currently selected. This option toggles between ascending and descending order. You cannot sort columns that are based on a LONGRAW or LONG VARBINARY datatype. To sort the records, choose Query, Sort from the menu, or press F10.

## Counting Query Results

Before you actually execute your query, you can count how many records it will return. If the number is very high, you might want to refine your query before executing it. To count the records, choose Query, Count from the menu bar, or press F4.

## Canceling a Query

Click the End Query icon
