# The Workspace

The Workspace option enables you to (view or) save your current workspace (i.e. open and/or cached windows). The next time that the application is started, the windows will then be restored on the screen, or cached in memory. Windows that are kept in memory are called resident windows. The maximum number of resident windows is specified with the Maximum Number of Resident Windows (application) property.


To save your workspace:


1.    From the menu bar, choose Tools, Options, Workspace. The Workspace dialog appears.
2.    Complete the dialog as follows:

- Select one of the radio buttons, depending on whether or not you want to include windows from the cache.
- The tree on the left will then show all currently open windows, or all currently open windows plus all currently cached windows.
- If desired, remove one or more windows from the tree by clicking the right mouse button, and then clicking Delete.
- Use the At Startup dropdown list to choose whether the windows must be opened in the workspace, or must be cached.


:::tip

The setting in the At Startup field applies to ALL windows in the workspace/cache. You cannot set it for individual windows.
