# Shortcut keys

The USoft tools respond to a number of default **shortcut keys**, also referred to as **function keys.** They can be individual keys (such as the F2 key) or key combinations (such as SHIFT+TAB).

## Shortcut keys in web applications

In web applications, functions are operated mostly by mouse clicks or other similar user actions (such as scrolling), as opposed to being operated by keystrokes.

However, USoft implements a number of popular standard keystrokes. For example, in forms, the TAB key is used by default to jump to the next field, and the SHIFT+TAB key is used to jump to the previous field.

## Shortcut keys in client/server interfaces

In Windows applications, in addition to a menu option and an icon button, there is a function key combination for each standard operation.

In USoft Windows Designer, you can set or override shortcut keys for a number of objects, especially menu options and buttons. Use the **Accelerator** and **Mnemonic** properties.

The lists below show shortcut keys for USoft's own applications, for example, the USoft Definer application.

### Shortcut keys by key

Most relevant USoft-specific function keys appear in **Bold**.
