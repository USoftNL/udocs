# A good element of guidance is self-contained

> [!NOTE]
> **Summary:**  A rule or advice must not rely on other rules to say all that it means.

A good element of guidance is self-contained. This principle has a lot of overlap with the [severability](/docs/Business_rules/Good_elements_of_guidance/A_good_element_of_guidance_is_severable.md) principle. Severability means the element of guidance can stand on its own. Self-containedness means that all the intended meaning is in the element of guidance itself:

[SBVR 1.5, 16.3.3 "The Wholeness Principle”:]

Principle: An element of guidance means only exactly what it says, so it must say everything it means.

(...) Each element of guidance must be self-contained…

… The full impact of an element of guidance for a body of shared guidance, of course, cannot be understood in isolation…

… Each element of guidance can be taken at face value for whatever it says.
