A good element of guidance is *practicable*. It must express something that can be applied in practical situations without further interpretation: it needs to be more definite than a general guideline. SBVR's definition of element of guidance*is practicable* is :

”The element of guidance is sufficiently detailed and precise that a person who knows the element of guidance can apply it effectively and consistently in relevant circumstances to know what behaviour is acceptable or not [...]” (SBVR 1.5)

Here is an example of a practicable element of guidance:

assuming that "free upgrade” is detailed elsewhere, perhaps in a definition.

Here is an example that is NOT a practicable element of guidance:
