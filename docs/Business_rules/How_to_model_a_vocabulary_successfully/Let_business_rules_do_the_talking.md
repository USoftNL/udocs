# Let business rules do the talking

When you create a set of specifications with USoft Studio, you build up 2 things in parallel: a rulebook and a concept structure. The concept structure you can visualise in SBVR concept diagrams.

In a USoft context, you are interested almost equally in both.

Having said that, the better starting point is the **rules**. It is easier to invent a concept structure that goes with the rules, than the other way around.

Make it your primary concern and your starting point to elicit business rules from your client's domain experts. This is easier for them than to respond to questions about possible concept structures. Let business rules do the talking: in the rules, the concepts and structures that you need will surface. The same goes for definitions. Last, SBVR diagrams [are only an extra accessory](/docs/Business%20rules/How%20to%20model%20a%20vocabulary%20successfully/Consider%20SBVR%20diagrams%20as%20helpful%20but%20secondary.md). Why is this? Because an SBVR diagram cannot express the same level of detail as textual formulations.
