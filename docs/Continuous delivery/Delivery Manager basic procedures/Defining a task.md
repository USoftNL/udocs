# Defining a task

To define a task and have it checked:

1. Choose Define, Tasks from the menu, or double-click the Tasks folder node on the Tasks tab of the UDeliver Catalog.

The Define Tasks window opens.

2. Enter a name for the Task.

3. Choose an existing Task Category name that you want the new Task to be classified by.

4. Define the task steps that you want the new Task to perform (below in this help topic). For each task step, set the task step parameters (below in this help topic).

5. When you are done, press the Check button in the right top corner.

If the Task is correct, the Correct = Yes indicator is set for it.

6. Save work.

You can now run the new task.

### Defining a task step

To define a task step:

1. Find the task for which you want to define the new task step. Do this by double-clicking the node for that Task on the Tasks tab of the UDeliver Catalog, or by right-clicking that node and choosing Define, or by choosing Define, Tasks from the menu and then querying the Define Tasks window.

2. In the box in the middle of the screen, type a Seqno to indicate where the new Task Step is to be inserted in the sequence of Task Steps.

3. In the Action field, press F12 and select an Action from the lookup window. The library of available actions may also be inspected by using the Actions tab of the UDeliver catalog.

If the selected Action has Parameters, these now appear in the box at the bottom of the window. You can also type the Action name manually in the Action field, but in this case you need to change input focus (press Arrow-Down, Arrow-Up) or save work and query the Parameters in the bottom box (press F2, F3).

4. Once you have the Parameters (if any) of the selected Action in view, set a value for each parameter (below in this help topic). Save work.

### Setting a task step parameter

To set a task step parameter:

1. In the bottom box of the Define Tasks window, in the row for the Parameter you want to set, identify the column indicated in the Type column.

2. In that column, consider pressing F12 if you want to select the parameter value from a list. This is generally best practice if the column presents such a list.

For example, if Type = Application, click in the Application column and then press F12. If Type = "Database account", click in the "Database account" column and then press F12.

There are columns where you can only type a value manually, for example, the "Folder or file column".

3. When you have finished selecting or typing the parameter value, proceed to the next parameter.
