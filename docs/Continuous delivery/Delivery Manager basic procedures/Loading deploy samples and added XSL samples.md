To load deploy samples and added XSL samples:

1. Choose Tools, Load Deploy Samples from the menu.

The Load Deploy Samples dialog appears.

2. Check if this dialog contains a warning section (red exclamation mark). If it does, you are about to overwrite deploy samples with the same name and characteristics, that may be valuable to you.

To preserve your own version of the deploy samples listed in this warning section, press Cancel, rename the deploy scripts listed to some other name, then return to Step 1.

3. Press OK.

The samples typed "Deploy scripts" have now been loaded as Attachments. Choose Release, Attachments to find them.

The samples typed "Added XSL" have now been loaded as Custom XSL. Choose Define, Custom XSL to find them.
