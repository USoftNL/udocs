# Defining a task category

To define a task category:

1. Make sure that the catalog on the left-hand side is in view; otherwise, choose View, Catalog from the menu.

2. Click the Tasks tab.

3. Double-click the "Task categories" node.

The "Task categories" window is displayed.

4. Enter a name and, optionally, a description for the task category. Save work.

A node for the task category appears on the Tasks tab of the catalog.

You can now assign tasks to the new task category in the Define Tasks window (choose Define, Tasks from the menu).
