## Tutorials and courseware

USoft supplies tutorials and courseware for learning how to put the USoft platform to best advantage.

### Tutorials in Knowledge Base

At community.usoft.com, where you are now, most sections of the Knowledge Base are **tutorials.** Some are reference sections: this is marked by a blue "REF.GUIDE” tag. The Knowledge Base is the part of USoft Community that is curated by the USoft R&D team.

> [!TIP]
> Many colleagues never access Community in any other way than via the Search bar. They use Knowledge Base like they use Wikipedia.
> This is absolutely fine, but when you are learning, to get a sense of overview, it can also be nice to drill down into the carefully named and sequenced chapters and sub-chapters of Knowledge Base. In Community Home, press the **USoft Knowledge Base** tile, or.

### Courseware exercises and solutions

USoft maintains and sells **courseware** modules that map 1:1 to the different Knowledge Base sections. Courseware is different from Knowledge Base tutorials in that it adds

- **Slide decks** for presentation,
- actual **example software** called “demoapps” that you can install, run, and develop further to try out. The “demoapp” examples are Travel Agency (a tour operator) and EU-Rent (a car rental company).
- hands-on **exercises** and solutions tested against these demoapps.

Courseware is ideal for training in a classroom setting, but also suitable for online teaching and for self-study.

Please contact your USoft representative or USoft Support for information on how to obtain and use courseware.
