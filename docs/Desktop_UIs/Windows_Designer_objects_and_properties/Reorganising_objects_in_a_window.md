# Re-organising objects in a window

You can change the look-and-feel of a window class by re-organising the hierarchy of objects that make up its contents.

First, **open** from the catalog the info box or dialog class that you want to change. Then, follow one of the scenarios below.

### Adding an object

To add **popular, standard objects** such as push buttons, you can use the INSERT menu in Window Designer's main menu:

1.Select the object where you want to insert the new object, either in the design view or in the object tree.

2.Choose the appropriate option from the main menu, for example, Insert, Button.

3.Position the new object precisely the way you want it, using the Tips for Positioning Objects (a separate article in this knowledge base section).

To add **more customised controls**, first create these controls, then insert them by dragging:

1.In the Controls catalog, make a user-defined subclass.

2.In the user-defined subclass, set properties and possibly insert objects, until you have the customised control that you want to use.

3.Open the info box or dialog where you want to insert your customised control.

4.From the Controls catalog, drag-and-drop the control class onto the object tree, making sure that you land on the object where you want to insert the control.

5.Position the new control precisely the way you want it, using the Tips for Positioning Objects (a separate article in this knowledge base section).

### Changing an object

You change an object by editing one or more of its properties, for example by following these steps:

1.In the object tree select the object you want to change.

2.Right-mouse-click and choose Property Inspector from the context menu.

The Property Inspector opens for the object you want to change.

3.In the second column of the Property Inspector, edit property values until you are satisfied the object has changed as intended.

### Dropping an object

You can drop an object from an info box or dialog by deleting it:

1.In the design view or object tree, select the object you want to drop.

2.Right-mouse-click and choose Delete.
