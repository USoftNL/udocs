# How to make or change a template's re-use selection

When you base a GUI application on a template, you can use all GUI classes known to the template, or you can make a re-use selection.

To make a template's re-use selection:

1.From the menu bar, choose File, Application Properties.

Select the Template tab page of the property sheet that appears. This tab page displays the name of the template (read-only).

2.At the Reuse prompt, click "Selected classes only".

3.Click the Change/View Selection button.

The Select dialog appears.

4.Select the classes you want to re-use, either by double-clicking their icons or by using the right mouse button or icons.

5.Click OK, or Close.

The dialog disappears and returns the focus to the Application Properties dialog.

6.Click OK, or Apply.

The new selection is saved and the Windows Designer's catalog is refreshed.
