# USoft Developer and ActiveX

ActiveX is Microsoft's component technology. It is a set of standards that include:

- Automation: A standard for calling applications.
- Controls: a visible component with properties, events, and methods, that can be called using Automation.
- Documents: components such as Word documents, Excel worksheets, etc.

ActiveX components can be embedded into applications. A growing number of vendors provide ActiveX components that offer everything from customizable user interface elements to database-aware charting controls to streaming media players. These components can now be used in USoft Applications. ActiveX components are often available for free, or you can build them yourself, using Visual Basic for example.
