# Contrasting business rules and Agile requirements

Business rules have different strengths than Agile requirements:

|**Strength of business rules**|**Strengths of Agile requirements**|
|--------|--------|
|Takes a wider view: business conduct|Concrete: linked to the project at hand|
|Wide audience: natural language|Clear task division: product owner vs. team|
|Fits into conceptual structure|Task-oriented cost estimates ("poker")|
|Level of detail is not an issue: rule either applies, or does not apply|Easy to prioritise along with bugfix tasks|



Scrum is increasingly applied as a project management methodology in a USoft project.

Scrum is, of course, a methodology while USoft is primarily a tooling platform. The two cannot be compared directly.

Even so, it is helpful to acknowledge how USoft brings different things to the table than Scrum:

|**USoft**|**Scrum**|
|--------|--------|
|Evolved from early Agile (in particular, DSDM)|Based on Agile Manifesto (2001)|
|Product-oriented|Process-oriented|
|Adds collaboration features in software|Adds decision-making principles|
|Does not stipulate role division|Starts from role division|



Â 

USoft is fully compatible with Scrum. Scrum is not a prerequisite for USoft.

## Conclusions

The combination of USoft and Agile is especially fruitful because the two bring complementary benefits to the table.

You can **combine** the USoft platform with task-oriented requirements tooling such as Jira.
