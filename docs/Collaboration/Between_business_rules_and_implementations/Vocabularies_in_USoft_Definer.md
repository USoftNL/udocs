# Vocabularies in USoft Definer

:::

A **vocabulary** is a body of shared concepts structured according to the relations between them.

Practically, in USoft Definer 11, a vocabulary is a collection of formulations that is subject to automatic colour-coding and hyperlinking as a set of formulations that clarify each other.


:::warning

The intended use is that you map a single USoft Studio vocabulary to a single USoft Definer vocabulary. If you work in this way, vocabulary is only a background concept that you should not spend time over.

:::

If you import (synchronise) formulations from USoft Studio to USoft Definer, a vocabulary is automatically created and all the imported formulations are made part of it. You can view the Vocabulary record via the Teamwork, Preparation, Vocabularies menu option.

The concept of vocabulary is introduced in USoft 11 to make it possible in the future to refer to multiple vocabularies from a single USoft Definer repository.
