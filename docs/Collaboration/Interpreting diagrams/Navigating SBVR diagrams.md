# Navigating SBVR diagrams

In a business domain described with SBVR, every concept is connected to a collection of neighbouring concepts, which are in turn connected to further neighbouring concepts. This creates a large landscape or concept map that typically does not fit on a single page or screen. You need multiple neighbouring SBVR diagrams.

## "Panning" your way through map areas

USoft Studio supports the idea of "panning" through interconnected SBVR map areas that together form a whole. This is reminiscent of foldable route maps for car drivers, where panning areas or pointer symbols (or both) allowed you an overlap with, or stepping stone to, the next neighbouring area:

To "pan" your way to a neighbouring area depicted by a different USoft Studio diagram:

1. In the first diagram, click on a subject that you suspect is in the "overlap", that is to say, exists also in the neighbouring area.

2. In the sidepane on the right, find the formulation ("... is located here .") that represents that second diagram. The sidepane shows formulations for all diagrams where the clicked concept appears.

3. Click on the " here " link in that formulation.

The diagram you were looking at is now replaced by the neighbouring diagram you wanted to "pan" to.
