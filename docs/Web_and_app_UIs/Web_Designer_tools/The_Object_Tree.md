# The Object Tree

The Object Tree appears by default on the right-hand side of the Web Designer tool interface. It accompanies the Preview Pane and is opened with it when you open a Page or Control from the catalog. Â

The object tree is a hierarchical list of all the objects contained in the page. Most importantly, it lets you open the Property Inspector for a specific object in the Page, so that you can view and edit that object's properties.
