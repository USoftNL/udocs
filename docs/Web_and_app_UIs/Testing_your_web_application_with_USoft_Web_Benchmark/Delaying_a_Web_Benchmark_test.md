# Delaying a Web Benchmark test

While recording a test, you can insert a number of seconds of waiting time. Each time the test is played back (in any playback mode), this number of seconds will elapse before the test moves to the next action.

The delay will show up as a delay action in the Edit test screen, where you can delete it, or change the duration of the delay.

To insert a number of seconds of delay time during a test recording:

1. Record the test until you have reached the point where you want a delay.

2. Click **Delay:**

4. Continue recording.
