## **$.udb.off()**

Removes a handler from an event (in the same way as in the jQuery implementation).

Returns the 'this' object.

*Syntax*

```js
.off( *eventType*, *handler(event)* )
```

The required *eventType* is a string that identifies the event to unbind. The possible values for the 'eventType' parameter are described in the Events reference section.

The required *handler(event)* is a function that identifies the entry to be removed.

*Example*

```js
function OnCommit(event,options){
    if(options.success)alert('Succeeded!');
}
$.udb.on('postcommit',OnCommit);
$.udb.off('postcommit',OnCommit);
```
