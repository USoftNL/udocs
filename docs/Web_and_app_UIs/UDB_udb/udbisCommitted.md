This article is about the **isCommitted()** function of the [udb object](/docs/Web_and_app_UIs/UDB_udb).

:::

## **$.udb.isCommitted()**

Checks for uncommitted manipulations, i.e. manipulations that have not committed to the database.

Returns a boolean.

*Syntax*

```js
.isCommitted( *context* )
```

The optional *context* indicates the frame context for which the function is called. If you are displaying pages in a FrameControl that has an Id value of "ApplicationFrame", then the context for those pages is "ApplicationFrame".

*Example*

```js
if (!$.udb.isCommitted()) {
 //alert the user for uncommitted manipulations
}
```
