This article is about the **genericHostVar()** function of the [udb object](/Web_and_app_UIs/UDB_udb).

:::

## **$.udb.genericHostVar()**

Assigns a value to a generic host variable. A generic host variable is a host variable (a name-value pair) that is needed in multiple actions or events. A host variable that is not generic is automatically cleared after the individual Page Engine call (query or manipulation request).

Returns the 'this' object.

*Syntax*

```js
.genericHostVar( *name*, *value* )
```

The required *name* is the name of the variable. The required *value* is the value being assigned to it.

Generic host variables and their values are valid and included in every Page Engine call until they are removed with the $.udb.clearGenericHostVars() function, or until you navigate to another page.

*Examples*

```js
$.udb.genericHostVar("ID","242")
```

```js
$.udb.genericHostVar("NAME","Jones")
```
