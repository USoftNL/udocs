## **$.udb.isTransactionChecked()**

Checks for unchecked manipulations, i.e. manipulations that have not been processed by the server by a .checkData() function call.

Returns a boolean.

*Syntax*

```js
.isTransactionChecked( *context* )
```

The optional *context* indicates the frame context for which the function is called. If you are displaying pages in a FrameControl that has an id value of "ApplicationFrame", then the context for those pages is "ApplicationFrame".

Example

```js
if ($.udb.isTransactionChecked()) {
    //alert the user for unchecked manipulations
}
```
