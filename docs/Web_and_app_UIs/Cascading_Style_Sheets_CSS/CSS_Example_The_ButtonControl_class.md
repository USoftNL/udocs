# CSS Example: The ButtonControl class

Here is an example of a style sheet rule that applies to the ButtonControl class within the BottomButtonGroup that exists in the Web Designer repository:

```language-css
#BottomButtonGroup .ButtonControl{
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
    border: none;
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: bolder;
}
```

The following style sheet rules apply to the label objects between the navigation buttons:

```language-css
#SaveButton,#RollbackButton{
    text-transform: uppercase;
    font-weight: bolder;
}
```

This example shows that selectors can be grouped in comma-separated lists.

In "Web Designer Classes & IDs", all Web Designer classes that can be influenced by style sheet rules are listed.
