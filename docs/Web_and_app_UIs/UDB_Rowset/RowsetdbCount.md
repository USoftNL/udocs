## **Rowset.dbCount()**

Returns the number of records in the row set that were queried from the server. Does NOT take into account any records inserted or deleted on the client.

Contrast with .rowCount().

*Syntax*

```js
*row-set*.dbCount()
```

*Example*

```js
$.udb('EMP').rowSet('current').dbCount();
```
