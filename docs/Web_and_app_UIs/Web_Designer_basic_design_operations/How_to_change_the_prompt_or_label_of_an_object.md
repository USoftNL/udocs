# How to change the prompt or label of an object

In Web Designer:

- TableColumn objects and GridCellControl objects have a Prompt property.
- All column controls except GridCellcontrols contain a prompt object with a label. The labels for column displays are initially determined in the Definer.
- Most other objects (such as buttons and labels) have a Label property.

To change the prompt or label of an object:

1. Select the object in the object tree, and open the Property Inspector.

2. On the General tab page, set the Prompt property or Label property to the desired value.

3. Save your work.
