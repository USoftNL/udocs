# How to make fields non-displayed

Which fields are displayed and which are not is initially determined in the Definer, but may be overruled later in Web Designer.

To make a field non-displayed, you need to delete its column control. To make a non-displayed field displayed (again), you need to insert a column control.

To make a field non-displayed:

1. From the catalog, open the page in which you want to make a field non-displayed.

2. In the object tree, select the appropriate column control.

3. Choose Edit, Delete from the menu bar, or choose Delete from the context menu.

4. Save your work.

To exclude a column from being retrieved from the database:

1. In the object tree, select the TableColumn object to be excluded.

2. Choose Edit, Delete from the menu bar, or choose Delete from the context menu.

3. Delete all column displays in the current page that refer to this column.
