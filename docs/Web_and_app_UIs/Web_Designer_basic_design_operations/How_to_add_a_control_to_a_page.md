# How to add a control to a page

To add a control to a page:

1. Open the page : Right-click on it in the Page tab of the catalog, then choose Open.

2. Expand the Object Tree until you find the object to which you want to add the control. Put input focus on this object to help yourself visually.

An easy way to find an object in the Object Tree is to click on, or near, that object in the Preview Pane.

3. Click the Controls tab of the catalog. Find the control class you want to add to the page by expanding the tree if necessary.

4. Drag the control class from the catalog onto the Object Tree and drop it on the object you had selected in Step 2.

5. If you need to change the order in which the newly added control and its siblings must appear, open the Property Inspector and adjust the control's Position property.

6. Save your work.
