# The caller keyword

If you want to refer to an event target in a script, you can use the **caller** keyword. For example:

```
doSomething( caller )
```

The **caller** keyword is deprecated and provided only for backward compatibility with USoft 8. A better alternative is to use the standard **this** keyword.
