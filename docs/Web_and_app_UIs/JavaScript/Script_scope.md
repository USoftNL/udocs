# Script scope

For a given script, script scope is the collection of classes and object in the application from which the script is available.

Before adding a new script, ask yourself if you want to:

- Add a script available everywhere in the application.
- Add a script available to a specific page class.
- Add a script to a specific object in a specific page class.
- Add a script available to every occurrence of a control (eg., a button class or a grid class) in a page.
